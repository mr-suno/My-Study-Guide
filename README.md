# Notes & Guides ✏️
A place to learn where everything is formatted with simple language, mostly because I'm kind of stupid.

### What's the Purpose? 🤔
Learning new things can be _hard_. It can be really annoying and other places can talk on and on about what everything means.
- To me, that's a waste of time. I create this place for **quick and fast** learning!

When learning something new, I want everything to be simple and really easy to understand. That's why I made this repository.

### What can I find? 🔍
Here you can find **everything** I'm really interested in learning about. This is pretty much a live dictionary on what I'm trying to study.

Stop wasting your time, you gotta lock in and actually learn something useful.
- If you're wanting to know something, come here and read about it, as long as I'm interested in it, it'll exist.
