# Special Keys in AHK
In here you're gonna learn about all of the different keys AHK's able to press for you.

Enough talking, let me just get the huge list of stuff out of the way. I don't expect you to memorize them, because I didn't either.
- Refer to this page if you ever need to know the different special keys!

**99**% of the sentences here are copied and pasted from eachother, this is really just for the keys themselves, you can ignore the stupid sentences after lol.

### Function Keys ü§ë
- **`{F1}`** through **`{F12}`**: **Every** function key, (F1, F2, ..., F12).

Each special character key represents another, for example:

1. **`!`**: The "**!**" key indicates the **Alt** key.
2. **`#`**: Also, the "**#**" (or "**pound**/**hashtag**") key represents the **Windows** key.
3. **`+`**: Similarly, the "**+**" expresses the **Shift** key.
4. **`^`**: Finally, the "**^**" (or "**caret**") key just means the **Control** key.
